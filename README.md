# Compiler
So far, there's no name, but I'll find one eventually.

This uses LLVM to implement a programming language compiler, with syntax that is similar to Rust, but missing a lot of features. 

Once importing is implemented, the standard library will be completed, but for now everything is done using Rust code to generate the IR for the main functions.

There's some error handling, but it doesn't cover every case yet.
